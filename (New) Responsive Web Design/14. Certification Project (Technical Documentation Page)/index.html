            Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. 
            A web framework provides a structure and starting point for creating your application, 
            allowing you to focus on creating something amazing while we sweat the details.
          </p>

          <p>
            Laravel strives to provide an amazing developer experience while providing powerful features 
            such as thorough dependency injection, an expressive database abstraction layer, queues and 
            scheduled jobs, unit and integration testing, and more. 
            There are a variety of tools and frameworks available to you when building a web application. 
            However, we believe Laravel is the best choice for building modern, full-stack web applications. 
            The followings are the reasons why.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
                A Progressive Framework - We like to call Laravel a "progressive" framework. 
                By that, we mean that Laravel grows with you. 
                If you're just taking your first steps into web development, 
                Laravel's vast library of documentation, guides, and video tutorials 
                will help you learn the ropes without becoming overwhelmed.
            </li>
            <li>
                A Scalable Framework - Laravel is incredibly scalable. 
                Thanks to the scaling-friendly nature of PHP and 
                Laravel's built-in support for fast, distributed cache systems 
                like Redis, horizontal scaling with Laravel is a breeze. 
                In fact, Laravel applications have been easily scaled 
                to handle hundreds of millions of requests per month.
            </li>
            <li>
                A Community Framework - Laravel combines the best packages in the PHP ecosystem 
                to offer the most robust and developer friendly framework available. 
                In addition, thousands of talented developers from around the world 
                have contributed to the framework. Who knows, 
                maybe you'll even become a Laravel contributor.

          <p>Before creating your first Laravel project, 
            you should ensure that your local machine has PHP and Composer installed. 
            In addition, we recommend installing Node and NPM.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
                Create a new Laravel project via the Composer create-project command:
            </li>
            <code>create-project
                composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app</code>
            <li>
                After the project has been created, 
                start Laravel's local development server using 
                the Laravel's Artisan CLI serve command:
            </li>
            <code>cd example-app
                php artisan serve</code>
            <li>
                Once you have started the Artisan development server, 
                your application will be accessible in your web browser at 
                http://localhost:8000. Next, you're ready to start taking 
                your next steps into the Laravel ecosystem. 
                Of course, you may also want to configure a database.

            We want it to be as easy as possible to get started 
            with Laravel regardless of your preferred operating system. 
            So, there are a variety of options for developing and 
            running a Laravel project on your local machine. 
            While you may wish to explore these options at a later time, 
            Laravel provides Sail, a built-in solution for running 
            your Laravel project using Docker.
          </p>

          <p>
            Docker is a tool for running applications and services in small, 
            light-weight "containers" which do not interfere with 
            your local machine's installed software or configuration. 
            This means you don't have to worry about configuring or 
            setting up complicated development tools such as web servers and 
            databases on your local machine. To get started, 
            you only need to install Docker Desktop.
          </p>
          <p>
            Laravel Sail is a light-weight command-line interface for 
            interacting with Laravel's default Docker configuration. 
            Sail provides a great starting point for building 
            a Laravel application using PHP, MySQL, and Redis 
            without requiring prior Docker experience.

            If you're developing on Linux and Docker Compose is already installed, 
            you can use a simple terminal command to create a new Laravel project. 
            For example, to create a new Laravel application in a directory named "example-app", 
            you may run the following command in your terminal:
            
            <code>curl -s https://laravel.build/example-app | bash</code>

            After the project has been created, 
            you can navigate to the application directory and 
            start Laravel Sail. Laravel Sail provides a simple command-line interface 
            for interacting with Laravel's default Docker configuration:
            
            <code>cd example-app
                    ./vendor/bin/sail up
            </code>

        <article>
            <p>
                Before we create a new Laravel application on your Windows machine, 
                make sure to install Docker Desktop. Next, you should ensure that 
                Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) is installed and enabled. 
                WSL allows you to run Linux binary executables natively on Windows 10. 
                Information on how to install and enable WSL2 can be found within 
                Microsoft's developer environment documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, you are ready to create your first Laravel project. 
                Launch Windows Terminal and begin a new terminal session 
                for your WSL2 Linux operating system. Next, 
                you can use a simple terminal command to create a new Laravel project. 
                For example, to create a new Laravel application in 
                a directory named "example-app", 
                you may run the following command in your terminal:
            </p>
            
            <code>curl -s https://laravel.build/example-app | bash</code>

            After the project has been created, 
            you can navigate to the application directory and 
            start Laravel Sail. Laravel Sail provides 
            a simple command-line interface for interacting with 
            Laravel's default Docker configuration:
            
            <code>cd example-app
                ./vendor/bin/sail up
            </code>

            If you're developing on a Mac and Docker Desktop is already installed, 
            you can use a simple terminal command to create a new Laravel project. 
            For example, to create a new Laravel application in a directory named "example-app", 
            you may run the following command in your terminal:
            
            <code>curl -s https://laravel.build/example-app | bash</code>

            <p>
                Sail installation may take several minutes while 
                Sail's application containers are built on your local machine.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the project has been created,
